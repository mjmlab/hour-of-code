## Using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) on Binder

Jupyter Notebook is a browser-based application for running python code interactively. You can use a local installation of jupyter or an online environment on binder. Just click the `binder` tag above.

- It uses a kernel (software that has python in background) to execute your code. If anything goes wrong, just `restart kernel`.

- You `run` each code cell with `shift+enter`
- Last line of code in block will **ALWAYS** be printed out.
